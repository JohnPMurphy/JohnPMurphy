- 👋 Hi, I’m @JohnPMurphy, I'm an engineer with a background in machine learning and security.
- 👀 I’m interested in lots of things, including embedded systems, deep learning, and procedural generation. I'm very interested in finding ways to tie these into my writng (I'm an award-nominated science fiction and fantasy writer), and hobbies like learning Japanese and roasting coffee.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CircuitPython! It's a real blast, and so much easier than the days of writing C and assembly for embedded controllers.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning and procedural generation projects.
- 📫 The best way to reach me is at my first name at JohnPMurphy.net, or by sending me a message through github.
